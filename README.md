## Description

This is a timed coding quiz app with multiple choice questions made using jQuery.
When player clicks the start button, a timer will start counting down and a series of multiple choice questions will be presented one at a time. Incorrect answers will penalize time, and when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game will be over and let player save initials and scores and show high scores that have been saved.
